3. Click **Build** (hammer) then  **Run** (play)  
For detailed platform-specific instructions, see [BUILDING.md.](BUILDING.md "BUILDING.md")  
**Default Credentials**  
The application uses a SQLite database (project.db) created on first run in the build directory.  
***Note:*** * Default admin credentials are set during initial database creation. Check with the project author or examine * *databasemanager.cpp* * for default login details.*  
**Database**  
The application uses SQLite (project.db) created automatically in the build directory. The database stores:  
- User accounts (admins and voters)  
- Election data  
- Candidate information  
- Vote records  
To reset the database, delete project.db from the build folder and restart the application.
